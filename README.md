# Pull Request Activity
I planned out this little activity for you ðŸ˜„, this will demonstrate how you can contribute to a git project without being a collaborator.  
I want you to do 3 main things:
1. Fork this repo
2. Add a variable holding your name as a string to line 2 of test.js
3. Make a pull request to me in this repo, for me to add your change to this repo
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>  

Once you're done with this activity, you can also check out this [site](https://learngitbranching.js.org) which can help you practice git branching and git in general

## Detailed steps/hints (Read this if you get stuck)
1. Press the fork button on the top right of this repo
2. Clone your forked copy of this repo to your computer
3. Create a new branch for the repo and title it with your name
4. Use "git checkout (branch name)" to move into that branch
5. In the new branch, edit the test.js file
6. In that test.js file add a line storing your name in a variable (e.g. ``const name = "Chris"``)
7. Do the whole: add, commit and push workflow 
8. (NOTE: the push might not work the first you try it in a new branch, if so use the "git push -u" command that the console tells you to use and then try to push)
9. Once the push goes through, go into github and go into the 'pull requests' tab
10. Then press the green 'new pull request' button
11. Then make sure that left side of the arrow shows my user-name and the repo name and the main branch(This will be what you are merging into)  and that your username and fork of the repo (+ your branch name) is on the right side of the arrow
12. Once the title, description and everything looks okay to you, click on the green "create pull request" button
13. You're all done from here, I will accept the completed pull request and you'll be able to see your change ðŸ˜„
